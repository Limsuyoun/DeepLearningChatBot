# AIChatBot
AIChatBot means Artifical intelligent chatbot using deep-learning techolnology.

# Motivation
Users talk to chatbots when they are bored. Through it, it is going to create chatbot that helps users relax. It also ensures that there are no questions that can not be answered.

# Design
The following figure is the operation structure of artificial intelligence chatbot. First, prepare meaningful data from movie subtitle files. Then we use Google's Tensorflow to prepare for learning. When learning, we use an artificial intelligence network model called RNN. At this time, we can choose CPU or GPU. GPU supports much faster speeds than CPU. The more the more training machine learns, the more he can create a smarter conversation ability like a person.
